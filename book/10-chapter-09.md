## Scenario Generation and Counterfactual Futures

World models allow counterfactual reasoning:

- What if oil drops 20%?
- What if rates spike unexpectedly?
- What if earnings compress simultaneously across sectors?

The system can:

- Inject shocks
- Simulate propagation
- Measure systemic impact

This transforms risk management into experimental science.
