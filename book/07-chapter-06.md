## Market Dynamics as Physics

Markets behave like complex physical systems:

- Energy = Liquidity
- Friction = Transaction costs
- Momentum = Trend persistence
- Phase transitions = Regime shifts

Simulation allows the system to internally test:

- Crashes
- Recessions
- Geopolitical shocks
- Liquidity squeezes

Before capital is exposed.
