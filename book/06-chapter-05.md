## Building a Financial World Model

A financial world model must define its state space carefully.

Example state vector:

- Interest rates
- Inflation
- Oil price
- Volatility index
- Market liquidity
- Earnings growth
- Portfolio allocation

The model learns:

    State(t) → Distribution of State(t+1)

This is not a price predictor.

It is a market simulator.
