## The Future of Intelligent Capital Allocation

The next generation of investment systems will:

- Simulate before allocating
- Stress-test before deploying
- Optimize across probabilistic futures

The question is no longer:

"What will the market do?"

The question becomes:

"Across thousands of possible worlds, where does capital survive and compound?"

That is the promise of Financial World Models.
