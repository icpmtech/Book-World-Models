## From Words to Worlds

LLMs are statistical mirrors of language.

World Models are generative simulators of dynamics.

**LLM:** "What usually happens after inflation rises?"

**World Model:** "If inflation rises 2%, rates increase 0.5%, and liquidity tightens, what does the market look like in 6 months?"

This shift moves AI from descriptive intelligence to anticipatory intelligence.
