## The Ceiling of Large Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) revolutionized artificial intelligence by mastering language prediction. Systems built on transformer architectures can summarize documents, answer complex questions, and even generate code.

However, they share a fundamental limitation:

They predict tokens — not reality.

An LLM can describe what might happen in a recession.
It cannot internally simulate the causal mechanics of one.

Financial markets are not text streams. They are dynamic systems shaped by feedback loops, delayed reactions, nonlinear transitions, and regime shifts.

To model markets properly, AI must move beyond sequence prediction toward state prediction.

This is where World Models enter the picture.
