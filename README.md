## About This Book

This book explores the frontier of artificial intelligence applied to financial markets — moving beyond the limitations of Large Language Models toward World Models capable of simulating market dynamics, regime shifts, and probabilistic futures.

Rather than predicting the next word in a sequence, a financial world model predicts the next state of a complex system.
