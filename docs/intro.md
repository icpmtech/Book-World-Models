# Financial World Models

**Simulating the Future of Capital Markets Beyond LLMs**

*Pedro Martins*

---

## About This Book

This book explores the frontier of artificial intelligence applied to financial markets —
moving beyond the limitations of Large Language Models toward World Models capable of
simulating market dynamics, regime shifts, and probabilistic futures.

Rather than predicting the next word in a sequence, a financial world model predicts the
next state of a complex system.
