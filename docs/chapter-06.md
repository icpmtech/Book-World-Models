## Market Dynamics as Physics

Markets behave like complex physical systems:

| Market Concept       | Physics Analogy     |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Liquidity            | Energy              |
| Transaction costs    | Friction            |
| Trend persistence    | Momentum            |
| Regime shifts        | Phase transitions   |

Simulation allows the system to internally test:

- Crashes
- Recessions
- Geopolitical shocks
- Liquidity squeezes

Before capital is exposed.
