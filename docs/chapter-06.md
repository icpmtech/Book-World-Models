## Market Dynamics as Physics

Markets behave like complex physical systems:

| Market Concept       | Physics Analogy     |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Liquidity            | Energy              |
| Transaction costs    | Friction            |
| Trend persistence    | Momentum            |
| Regime shifts        | Phase transitions   |

Simulation allows the system to internally test:

- Crashes
- Recessions
- Geopolitical shocks
- Liquidity squeezes

Before capital is exposed.

## Market Regime Cycles

Just as matter transitions between physical states (solid, liquid, gas), markets transition between regimes: expansion, overheating, contraction, and recovery.

The world model learns the **transition probabilities** between regimes from historical data, enabling it to estimate the likelihood of a phase transition before it occurs.

## Causal Chains and Shock Propagation

A key advantage of the physics analogy is that physical systems obey **causal laws** — a shock at one point propagates predictably through the system. Markets share this structure.

Unlike a language model that describes historical correlations, a world model traces **causality** — enabling it to simulate how a novel shock (e.g. an unexpected rate hike) will propagate through equities, credit, and currencies over time.
