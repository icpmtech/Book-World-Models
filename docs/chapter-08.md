# Chapter 8

## Portfolio Simulation Engines

Traditional backtesting is linear and historical.

World simulation is **probabilistic and forward-looking**.

Instead of replaying the past, the model generates:

> 10,000 possible futures.

For each future, it measures:

- Drawdown
- Recovery time
- Dividend sustainability
- Bankruptcy probability
- Volatility clustering

The portfolio is evaluated not by past performance but by **future resilience**.
