# Chapter 12

## The Future of Intelligent Capital Allocation

The next generation of investment systems will:

- Simulate before allocating
- Stress-test before deploying
- Optimize across probabilistic futures

The question is no longer:

> "What will the market do?"

The question becomes:

> "Across thousands of possible worlds, where does capital survive and compound?"

That is the promise of **Financial World Models**.
